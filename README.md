## Project Overview

Photo sharing and photo storage services like to have location data for each photo that is uploaded. With the location data, these services can build advanced features, such as automatic suggestion of relevant tags or automatic photo organization, which help provide a compelling user experience. Although a photo's location can often be obtained by looking at the photo's metadata, many photos uploaded to these services will not have location metadata available. This can happen when, for example, the camera capturing the picture does not have GPS or if a photo's metadata is scrubbed due to privacy concerns.

If no location metadata for an image is available, one way to infer the location is to detect and classify a discernable landmark in the image. Given the large number of landmarks across the world and the immense volume of images that are uploaded to photo sharing services, using human judgement to classify these landmarks would not be feasible.

In this project we will build models to automatically predict the location of the image based on any landmarks depicted in the image. we will go through the machine learning design process end-to-end: performing data preprocessing, designing and training CNNs, comparing the accuracy of different CNNs, and deploying an app based on the best CNN we trained.
By completing this lab, you demonstrate your understanding of the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline. 


## Project Instructions

#### Setting up in the Udacity Project Workspace

1. Start the workspace by clicking on `Project Workspace` in the left menu in the page
2. When prompted on whether you want a GPU or not, please ANSWER YES (the GPU is going to make everything several times faster)


#### Setting up locally

This setup requires a bit of familiarity with creating a working deep learning environment. While things should work out of the box, in case of problems you might have to do operations on your system (like installing new NVIDIA drivers) that are not covered in the class. Please do this if you are at least a bit familiar with these subjects, otherwise please consider using the provided Udacity workspace that you find in the classroom.

1. Open a terminal and clone the repository, then navigate to the downloaded folder:
	
	```	
		git clone https://github.com/udacity/cd1821-CNN-project-starter.git
		cd cd1821-CNN-project-starter
	```
    
2. Create a new conda environment with python 3.7.6:

    ```
        conda create --name udacity_cnn_project -y python=3.7.6
        conda activate udacity_cnn_project
    ```
    
    NOTE: you will have to execute `conda activate udacity_cnn_project` for every new terminal session.
    
3. Install the requirements of the project:

    ```
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Install and open Jupyter lab:
	
	```
        pip install jupyterlab
		jupyter lab
	```

### Developing your project

Now that you have a working environment, execute the following steps:

>**Note:** Complete the following notebooks in order, do not move to the next step if you didn't complete the previous one.

1. Open the `cnn_from_scratch.ipynb` notebook and follow the instructions there
2. Open `transfer_learning.ipynb` and follow the instructions
3. Open `app.ipynb` and follow the instructions there

## Dataset Info

The landmark images are a subset of the Google Landmarks Dataset v2.
